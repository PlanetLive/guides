From the [article on Ramanujan's math structures](https://www.quantamagazine.org/srinivasa-ramanujan-was-a-genius-math-is-still-catching-up-20241021/), here are the 3 starter graphs we're creating using javascript:

"Algebraic varieties, or shapes cut out by polynomial equations that can be written as sums of variables raised to whole-number powers. 

**1. A line**, for instance, is cut out by the equation: &nbsp; x + y = 0, 

**2. A circle** by: &nbsp; x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 1, 

**3. A figure eight** by: &nbsp; x<sup>4</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> − y<sup>2</sup>. 

While the line and circle are completely smooth, the figure eight has a point where it intersects itself — a singularity."

## Upcoming Starter Graphs

From the article on Ramanujan, here are the 3 starter graphs I'd like to create using javascript - a line, a circle, and infinity (like we already made in the CoLab):

"Algebraic varieties, or shapes cut out by polynomial equations that can be written as sums of variables raised to whole-number powers. 

A line, for instance, is cut out by the equation x + y = 0, 

A circle by x<sup>2</sup> + y^2 = 1, 

A figure eight by x^4 = x^2 − y^2. 

While the line and circle are completely smooth, the figure eight has a point where it intersects itself — a singularity."
